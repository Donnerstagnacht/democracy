  "legalQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "Does the app make decisions online?",
      "answer": "No, no decisions are made online. All decisions are made offline and simultaneously mirrored online. However, the decision making process can be done online, but the decision itself always takes place at a meeting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do statutes have to be changed for the introduction of this app?",
      "answer": "No, the app only mirrors decisions that are made in real meetings in the ways previously provided for in the statutes. However, the administrative processes surrounding the decision are automated so that the contents of the statutes (e.g. decisions) can be processed more efficiently. Accordingly, the system conforms to previous statutes."

  "introductionQuestions": [

The Federal Party Congress 2019 has also formally approved the introduction of such a system in the main proposal."

  "implementationQuestions": [

    },
    {
      "question": "Is there already a proposal for implementation?",
      "answer": "Yes, we would prefer a progressive web app, as it is platform independent. For this we currently prefer Angular + AngularMaterial in combination with AngularFire and Firestore. Angular is a modern framework for frontend development and Firestore is a modern NoSQL database as part of a SAAS (Software as a Service) offering."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I find more information on technical implementation?",
      "answer": "More information about the technical implementation can be found in our Github repository. The project is open source, so all source code can be viewed and tracked online."

    {
      "question": "Why is a Google database being considered with Firestore?",
      "answer": "Google Firestore is a state-of-the-art, cloud based NoSQL database as part of a SAAS (Software as a Service offering), which is available free of charge with a generous free tier and many standardized backend services. As this project has very limited resources with one volunteer developer, Firestore offers a good start to get to the goal quickly. The database is also DSGVO compliant when used correctly.
